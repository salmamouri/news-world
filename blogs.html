        <h3>2. Diference between Regular Function and Arrow Function?</h3>
        <p>
          The common difference between regular and arrow function is that in
          regular function you have to use 'function' keyword in starting but in
          arrow function you dont have to use 'function' keyword. In regular
          function, Arguments keywords can be used to access the arguments of
          which passed to function but Arrow functions do not have an arguments
          binding.Regular functions are constructible, they can be called using
          the new keyword but arroe functions are constructible.
